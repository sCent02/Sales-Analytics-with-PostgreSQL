# Sales-Analytics-with-PostgreSQL
This project demonstrates my SQL and Python automation skills by designing a PostgreSQL database for a simple sales system and writing analytical queries to extract business insights.

It includes:

- Database schema design (customers, products, orders)

- Sample data loading from SQL/CSV

- Analytical SQL queries for real-world reporting use cases

- Python automation scripts to initialize the database and run queries automatically

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `schema.sql` ‚Üí Defines tables (customers, products, orders)
- `insert_data.sql` ‚Üí Inserts sample data into the tables
- `queries.sql` ‚Üí Collection of analytical SQL queries
- `init_db.py` ‚Üí Python script to set up the database schema and load data
- `run_queries.py` ‚Üí Python script to execute queries from queries.sql and display results
- `data/` ‚Üí CSVs with sample data for loading

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sCent02/Sales-Analytics-with-PostgreSQL
   cd Sales-Analytics-with-PostgreSQL
   ```

2. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install psycopg2 pandas
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. Create and initialize the database:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

2. Run analytical queries:
```bash
python run_queries.py
```

### üëâ The Python script will:
- Connect to PostgreSQL automatically
- Read queries from queries.sql
- Print results directly in the terminal


## üìä Example Insights

- Top 5 customers by spend

```sql
Running query:
 -- 1. Find top 5 customers by total spend
SELECT c.name, SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Result:
```yaml
                 name total_spent
0   Kristin Schneider    10357.67
1        Philip Lopez     5452.55
2  Natasha Thomas DDS     4967.39
3        Raymond Hall     3786.37
4    Christine Jarvis     2311.81
```
Explanation:
This query identifies the highest-value customers by calculating their total spending. Businesses can use this insight for loyalty programs, personalized offers, or retention strategies.


- Monthly sales trends

```sql
 -- 2. Monthly sales trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS monthly_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
```

result:
```yaml
                      month monthly_sales
0 2025-03-01 00:00:00+08:00       6748.46
1 2025-04-01 00:00:00+08:00       4831.00
2 2025-05-01 00:00:00+08:00       2289.53
3 2025-06-01 00:00:00+08:00       4992.69
4 2025-07-01 00:00:00+08:00       6534.64
5 2025-08-01 00:00:00+08:00       7188.69
6 2025-09-01 00:00:00+08:00        110.88
```
Explanation:
This query shows monthly revenue trends. Businesses can track seasonality, growth patterns, and performance over time. It‚Äôs essential for forecasting and strategic planning.


- Best-selling product categories

```sql
-- 3. Best-selling product category
SELECT p.category, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_units_sold
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_units_sold DESC
```

Result:
```yaml
      category  total_units_sold
0         Toys                24
1  Electronics                23
2    Groceries                19
3        Books                17
4     Clothing                15
```

Explanation:
This query highlights the top-selling product categories. Businesses can use this for inventory management, marketing focus, and cross-selling strategies.
